# Diabetes Progression Predictor – Streamlit App

## Overview

This project is a **machine learning web application** built with **Streamlit** that predicts diabetes disease progression using a **Lasso Regression model** trained on the scikit-learn diabetes dataset.
The application provides an interactive interface, severity interpretation, and visual feedback for educational and demonstration purposes.
